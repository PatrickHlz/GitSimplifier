# GitSimplifier

Git simplifier for commit/tag and push faster

This program is working on **Arch Linux**, and other **Linux** supported by a **bashrc**.
This is designed for **Epita** student, but it can be also be used by other Linux users by changing the **origin path**.

## Installation

1. First step : After cloning the repo `https://github.com/PatrickHlz/GitSimplifier.git`, I recommand you to create a repo like this **PERSONAL_CONFIG** like this `mkdir ~/afs/PERSONAL_CONFIG` and use this command in your **shell**  `echo "source ~/afs/PERSONAL_CONFIG/gall.sh" >> ~/.bashrc`.

use it in your **shell**, in the correct folder (the git one)

2. Then
After installing the folder correctly, you must have a `source ~/afs/CONFIG_PERSO/gall.sh` in your `.bashrc`.
